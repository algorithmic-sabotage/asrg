<p><em>“We live in the age of digital data, and in that age mathematics has become the parliament of politics. The social law has become interwoven with models, theorems and algorithms. With digital data, mathematics has become the dominant means in which human beings coordinate with technology … Mathematics is a human activity after all. Like any other human activity, it carries the possibilities of both emancipation and oppression.” — Politically Mathematics Manifesto, 2019<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></em></p>
<p>In Europe and around the world, AI systems are developed and deployed for harmful and discriminatory forms of state surveillance. From the use of biometrics for identification, recognition and categorization, to predictive systems in various decision-making and resource allocation capacities, AI in law enforcement disproportionately targets already marginalized communities, undermines legal and procedural rights, and enables mass surveillance. When AI systems are deployed in contexts of law enforcement, security and migration control (including the policing of social security), the power imbalance between the authorities and the surveilled is even more profound. This means that there is an even greater risk of harm, and violations of fundamental rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p>AI not only undermines due process but produces thoughtlessness, in the sense that political philosopher Hannah Arendt meant when interpreting the actions of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann; the inability to critique instructions, the lack of reflection on consequences, a commitment to the belief that a correct ordering is being carried out. For AI’s impacts on the ground, the operative concerns are discrimination and segregation. AI is a racist technology, in the sense that AI operates so as to segregate, and racism itself can be understood as a technology of segregation<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This is easy to see when it comes to facial recognition, one of the most egregious applications that AI has so far gifted to society. It is not just that facial recognition seems to perform less well on people of colour, it is that it carries out what Simone Browne calls <em>“digital epidemermalisation: the exercise of power cast by the disembodied gaze of certain surveillance technologies &hellip; that can be employed to do the work of alienating the subject by producing a truth about the racial body and one&rsquo;s identity (or identities) despite the subject&rsquo;s claims”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></em>.</p>
<p>Facial recognition is a particularly invasive, violent and biased technology that reinforces power imbalances, discrimination, racism, inequality and authoritarian societal control. Within the European Union, for instance, AI-based facial recognition technologies are used in public spaces to capture bystanders’ facial proportions and classify them into racial and ethnic categories such as Roma and Sinti, implying that non-white people are automatically suspect and unwanted<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Reclaiming political agency from the engines of abstraction and classification means taking solidarity as the starting point of our becoming, through <em>a culture of invention, design, and planning</em> that cares for communities and the collective, and never entirely relinquishes agency and intelligence to automation. The Police Officers Faces (POF) dataset is an investigative counter-surveillance artistic project that focuses on facial recognition technology, particularly its use by the law enforcement agencies. It is a large-scale dataset comprising 88,783 facial images of thousands of police officers. These images have been retrieved from the internet and are employed for facial recognition purposes. In this project, the conventional paradigm, in which the powerful observe and the powerless are observed, is reversed.</p>
<p>In order to address the dehumanising effects of the expansion of automated discrimination and segregation, the exacerbation of harm and the overarching correlation, the project advocates for a distinct technical mentality, a collective “counter-intelligence,” which seeks to emphasise the influence of citizens and grassroots realities in uncovering facts, focusing on the impact of collective actions to reveal wrongdoing and the collaborative production of social justice. By employing a multifaceted approach encompassing targeted data collection and compilation, social engineering, and rigorous analysis, the Police Officers Faces (POF) dataset has established a comprehensive and structural alternative framework for the emancipatory empowerment of community members engaged in copwatch and other counter-surveillance practices.</p>

  Dataset Description
  <a class="anchor" href="#dataset-description">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Police Officers Faces (POF) dataset is a compilation of thousands of facial images of police officers obtained from online sources. In particular, the dataset consists of 88,783 aligned and cropped 200×280 pixel facial images of thousands of police officers, with each image centred on a single face. The majority of the images have been labelled with the name of the individual depicted. The mean number of facial images per individual is <code>12.22</code>. In contrast to the majority of other existing facial datasets, these images were captured in entirely uncontrolled settings with subjects who were uncooperative. Consequently, there are considerable discrepancies in terms of pose, resolution, lighting, expression, scene, imaging conditions and parameters, and so forth. The dataset includes cropped and aligned facial image files in <code>JPEG</code> format, as well as <code>JSON</code> and <code>CSV</code> metadata files containing facial box coordinates and facial biometric landmark data. Additionally, the dataset comprises full individual real names and attribution data in <code>JSON</code> and <code>CSV</code> files. Each facial image is automatically annotated with seventy-three attributes belonging to three distinct recognition tasks: age group, gender and visual attributes, such as hair colour, face shape and the presence of make-up.</p>
