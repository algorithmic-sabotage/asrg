      <description>The Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) is an ongoing, conspiratorial, aesthetico-political, practice-led research framework focused on the intersection of digital culture and information technology. # It explores the diversity of practices and the role of artistic activism in exposing, critiquing, disrupting and countering the encroachments of algorithmic systems of power, control and exploitation, with the objective of strengthening, promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms by offering interdisciplinary pathways to empower the public.</description>

In order to regain our techno-political dangerousness and reestablish collective subjectivity in the context of contemporary technologies, the Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) challenges existing assumptions and patterns of political action by organising a broad-based intervention for the militant emancipatory defence of the need for community constraint of harmful algorithmic systems and their surrounding political projects, through the mechanism of communitarian assembly, a bottom-up, horizontal structure that functions as a means to unite the spaces of technical concern and collective action.</description>

      <description>Intertwined Feedback Loops A series of intertwined feedback loops that unfold from several interrelated briefs for intellectual and practical exploration. Posted: Jun 13, 2024. Modified: Jul 11, 2024 Context # The Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) has drawn a series of intertwined feedback loops that unfold from several interrelated briefs for intellectual and practical exploration. These critically subversive flowcharts have been informed by research on digital labour exploitation, invisible infrastructures, techno-colonialism, automatised technologies of tracking, monitoring and surveillance and many other contemporary phenomena at the intersection between technology and society.</description>

      <description>Theorizing “Algorithmic Sabotage” An urgent intervention rooted in the militant liberation struggles of the most oppressed within the arena of global computational racial capitalism. Posted: Jun 13, 2024. Modified: Jul 1, 2024 Extract #8: “Algorithmic Sabotage” is the starting point for a radical, feminist and decolonial political praxis that seeks to militantly transcend the deep-seated necropolitical tendencies, predictive interventions, thoughtless optimisations, increasing flows of fascist affordances and the violence of solutionism that AI represents and implements in every aspect of social infrastructure, confirming the dystopian potentials of machine intelligence.</description>
