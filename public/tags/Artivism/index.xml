      <description>Technopolitics of Fronts Mailing list for the coordination and organisation of the communitarian assembly on “Technopolitics of Fronts” “above” and “below” the algorithm. Posted: Jul 17, 2024. Modified: Jul 18, 2024 Graphic: © Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group | The typeface used is Avara from Velvetyne Foundry: https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/avara/ Context # “Nothing’s more important than stopping fascism, because fascism will stop us all.” — Fred Hampton, Black Panther Party1&#xA;In order to regain our techno-political dangerousness and reestablish collective subjectivity in the context of contemporary technologies, the Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) challenges existing assumptions and patterns of political action by organising a broad-based intervention for the militant emancipatory defence of the need for community constraint of harmful algorithmic systems and their surrounding political projects, through the mechanism of communitarian assembly, a bottom-up, horizontal structure that functions as a means to unite the spaces of technical concern and collective action.</description>

Posted: Jun 13, 2024. Modified: Jul 1, 2024 Extract #8: “Algorithmic Sabotage” is the starting point for a radical, feminist and decolonial political praxis that seeks to militantly transcend the deep-seated necropolitical tendencies, predictive interventions, thoughtless optimisations, increasing flows of fascist affordances and the violence of solutionism that AI represents and implements in every aspect of social infrastructure, confirming the dystopian potentials of machine intelligence.</description>
