      <description>Technopolitics of Fronts Mailing list for the coordination and organisation of the communitarian assembly on “Technopolitics of Fronts” “above” and “below” the algorithm. Posted: Jul 17, 2024. Modified: Jul 18, 2024 Graphic: © Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group | The typeface used is Avara from Velvetyne Foundry: https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/avara/ Context # “Nothing’s more important than stopping fascism, because fascism will stop us all.” — Fred Hampton, Black Panther Party1&#xA;In order to regain our techno-political dangerousness and reestablish collective subjectivity in the context of contemporary technologies, the Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) challenges existing assumptions and patterns of political action by organising a broad-based intervention for the militant emancipatory defence of the need for community constraint of harmful algorithmic systems and their surrounding political projects, through the mechanism of communitarian assembly, a bottom-up, horizontal structure that functions as a means to unite the spaces of technical concern and collective action.</description>
