  About the Workshop
  <a class="anchor" href="#about-the-workshop">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In this intensive, one-day, eight-hour workshop, the Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) will undertake a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the critical concept of <em>“algorithmic sabotage,”</em> situating it as a prefigurative praxis explicitly designed to oppose a technopolitics that exacerbates neoliberal inequalities and amplifies various dimensions of necropolitics within systems that already perpetuate forms of segregation, racialization, and exclusion.</p>
<p>Throughout the workshop, <em>“algorithmic sabotage”</em> will be operationalized through both <em>“legal”</em> and <em>“illegal”</em> orientations, with its application analyzed within broader political, cultural, societal, and technological struggles—both <em>“above”</em> and <em>“below”</em> the algorithm. The insights generated will deepen the understanding of its strategic approaches and aesthetic manifestations, contributing to the development of transformative alternatives centered on agency, resistance, and refusal.</p>
<p><span style="color:grey">* The artistic approach will play a central role in introducing and formulating methods and tactics that foster awareness, experimentation, and agency. Additionally, it will provide critical literacy in the context of advanced computation, which has the potential to deepen existing inequalities and injustices, intensifying divisions and advancing the trajectory toward algorithmic authoritarianism.</span></p>
<h3 id="workshop-outcomes">
  Workshop Outcomes
  <a class="anchor" href="#workshop-outcomes">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The workshop has been meticulously designed with the aim of achieving three core objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The primary objective is to facilitate the establishment of a cohesive community, fostering robust networking among individuals who occupy pivotal roles across diverse fields, including creative and subversive artistic activism, technical expertise, and collective action. Additionally, the workshop will function as a platform for substantive interdomain networking, enabling the formation of meaningful connections between individuals with varied expertise and backgrounds, thereby facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secondary objective is to promote a comprehensive and critical analysis of the spectrum of collective techno-disobedience. This encompasses instances where techno-disobedience is strategically employed as a countermeasure against the oppressive constraints imposed by algorithmic state repression, right-wing political structures, and the deleterious consequences of unchecked techno-solutionism. In this context, the workshop will present and examine innovative strategies for withdrawal, refusal, sabotage, and the negotiation of novel <em>“lines of flight”</em> from techno-feudal forms of domination, as a means of challenging the ascendant tide of right-wing ideologies and the pervasive discourse of securitization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third objective is to engage participants in collaborative, knowledge-generating processes that aim to further refine this approach, alongside the methodologies that underpin it. The goal is to create sustainable pathways for solidarity, emancipation, and empowerment.</p>
</li>

<p>The workshop is designed to engage a diverse range of participants, including investigative journalists, human rights defenders, artists, hackers, researchers, political activists, and groups of people who are joining forces for the occasion. A maximum of 25 individuals, aged 18 years and older, will be admitted to the workshop. The event will take place over one day, comprising eight hours of structured instruction, with scheduled breaks between sessions to foster active participation.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the workshop, titled <em>Illegal Directions ── ‘Algorithmic Sabotage’ &amp; Self-Organization</em>, will be conducted in an offline format. For participants unable to attend in person, a secure online connection will be provided to facilitate real-time participation. The workshop will be conducted in English, Greek, and German. Participants with limited proficiency in these languages may experience challenges in fully engaging with the content, which could affect their overall participation.</p>
