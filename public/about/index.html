</h3>
<p>The Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) operates within a rigorously interrogated conceptual framework that foregrounds the in-depth analysis of the critical concept of <em>“algorithmic sabotage.”</em> This concept functions as a foundational lens for the methodical formulation of artistic-activist and prefigurative techno-political strategies and aesthetics, aimed at contesting, subverting, and dismantling necropolitical technologies that perpetuate entrenched structural injustices, entrench algorithmic authoritarianism, and intensify the deleterious impacts of unchecked technofascistic solutionism.</p>
<p>The research is organized around the following core inquiries:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How can the intersection of <em>“algorithmic sabotage,”</em> art, and activism be strategically harnessed to disrupt and challenge the dominance of pervasive, regulatory technological paradigms, while cultivating subversive aesthetic and political counter-narratives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In what ways does technological disobedience, conceptualized through the critical concept of <em>“algorithmic sabotage,”</em> enable the emergence of novel modalities of collective agency, the design and development of digital tools, and the creation of transformative, militantly content-driven interventions that challenge and disrupt hegemonic technological edifice?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that refusal constitutes a critical form of technopolitical praxis, what are the broader implications of <em>“algorithmic sabotage”</em> as a mechanism for dissent and resistance within political, social, and artistic contexts, particularly in challenging systemic power structures?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can <em>“algorithmic sabotage,”</em> within the context of artistic activism, inform and empower self-organized, technologically-mediated strategies that advance justice, promote accountability, and facilitate the achievement of equitable and inclusive societal outcomes?</p>
</li>
</ol>
