<p>The Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) operates within a rigorously constructed analytical framework that forms the foundation for a comprehensive, multidimensional analysis of the critical concept of <em>“algorithmic sabotage”</em>—a concept approached with maximal alignment to a technopolitics conducive to human and environmental flourishing. Situated as a paradigm formed through dialectical interplay and strategically coordinated synergy, this concept integrates the intricate dynamics of agency, refusal, and resistance while simultaneously grounding the methodological development of militant tactics, prefigurative technopolitical frameworks, and radical aesthetics, aimed at creating rupture points within advanced computation, which fuses off-the-scale technology with emergent totalitarianism—perpetuating systemic injustices and exacerbating the harms of unchecked technofascistic solutionism.</p>
<p>The research is structured around the following core questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How can the intersection of <em>“algorithmic sabotage,”</em> art, and activism be strategically harnessed to sever and disrupt entrenched computational assemblages that, through their pervasive reactionary technopolitics, exert a suffocating grip on our lives, freedoms, and sense of agency? In what ways can this convergence provide fertile ground for the emergence of subversive aesthetic and political counter-narratives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What broader applications does <em>“algorithmic sabotage”</em> offer as a powerful bottom-up mechanism for mobilizing alternative approaches rooted in feminist and decolonial perspectives? How can it contribute to the realization of emancipatory visions by advancing convivial technologies that uphold pro-social values—such as care, solidarity, mutual aid, creativity, diversity, and inclusion—and drive the reassertion and reconstitution of the commons?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can <em>“algorithmic sabotage”</em> function as a critical conduit for both reclamation and enlightenment, informing and empowering grassroots, self-organized, and technologically mediated initiatives that advance justice, enhance accountability, and catalyze the reconstruction of equitable societal perspectives? In the context of institutionalized cruelty and neglect, how might it encourage uncompromising radicality—from anonymous everyday solidarity to bold acts of resistance?</p>
</li>
</ol>
