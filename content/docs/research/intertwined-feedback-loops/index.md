## Context

The Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) has drawn a series of intertwined feedback loops that unfold from several interrelated briefs for intellectual and practical exploration. These critically subversive flowcharts have been informed by research on digital labour exploitation, invisible infrastructures, techno-colonialism, automatised technologies of tracking, monitoring and surveillance and many other contemporary phenomena at the intersection between technology and society.

## Intertwined Feedback Loops 

### ABOLISHING AI

_This is a preliminary version of an intertwined feedback loop that promotes an AI abolitionist praxis by exposing the multiplicity of its harms and its irrevocable entanglement with various registers of violence, its nationalist, authoritarian and fascist logics, and its ideological commitment to algorithmic cruelty on a grand scale._

### AI DISSIDENTS

_This intertwined feedback loop serves to illustrate the inherent constraints and obfuscations associated with AI within the context of “Algorithmic Empire.”_

### AI’S ALGORITHMIC VIOLENCE

_This is an initial version of an intertwined feedback loop that illustrates the various manifestations of algorithmic violence perpetrated by AI in epistemic, administrative, and structural forms._
