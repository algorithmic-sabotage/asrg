## Context

Through diagrammatic language, which serves as an essential visual and conceptual framework for perceiving and engaging with the flow of information and operations, the Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) develops a series of abstract flowcharts. These visual representations function within an interconnected network of associations, wherein elements—terms and geometrical shapes—dynamically interact, influencing one another in a continuous feedback loop. This iterative process is designed to foster both critical inquiry and applied exploration.

The flowcharts are anchored in thorough, multifaceted research on key topics, including digital labor exploitation, the hidden infrastructures underpinning technological ecosystems, the pervasive dynamics of techno-colonialism, and the widespread automation of tracking, monitoring, and surveillance technologies. Additionally, they critically engage with intersecting concerns, such as the ideological forces shaping technological development, the social and political ramifications of unrestrained technosolutionism, and other contemporary phenomena at the intersection of technology and society.

<span style="color:grey">* Please be advised that the information presented on this page represents a preliminary overview, which will be periodically revised and expanded as new insights and data become available. The six abstract flowcharts below represent an incomplete subset, functioning as visual notes within a broader series of forty diagrams, which will be made available in the near future.</span>

### Diagrams

### 2024 - Abolishing AI

_Artificial intelligence (AI) represents one of the most condensed forms of oppressive, anti-worker, and anti-community technology. This abstract flowchart advances an artificial intelligence (AI) abolitionist praxis by critically exposing its harmful impacts, its role in intensifying existing necropolitics, and the historical entanglement of its mathematical optimizations with eugenics._

<div class="caption"><img src="images/output-378.png">The diagram <em>‘Abolishing AI’</em> is available for download in <code>PDF</code> format via the following link: <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/ts0tiWAKkphB5yhEkd3bEhDv/">https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/ts0tiWAKkphB5yhEkd3bEhDv/</a> <span style="color:grey">| © Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group.</span></div>

#### Notes on the Diagram

The above preliminary formulation of an intertwined feedback loop advances an artificial intelligence (AI) abolitionist praxis by critically exposing its varied detrimental impacts, its inextricable entanglement with multiple forms of violence, and its role in perpetuating large-scale algorithmic cruelty. Furthermore, it examines the historical currents that inform both its technical development and broader ideological and political trajectory, including eugenics and white supremacy, its tendency toward ‘fascistic solutionism,’ and its connections with Silicon Valley ideologies such as rationalism and neoreaction.

### 2024 - AI Dissidents

_This intertwined feedback loop aims to critically challenge the mystifications and obfuscations embedded within artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in relation to the conceptual framework of the ‘Algorithmic Empire.’_

<div class="caption"><img src="images/output-162.png">The diagram <em>‘AI Dissidents’</em> is available for download in <code>PDF</code> format via the following link: <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/xoK2qrqbuUwwV57HfVk12HVi/">https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/xoK2qrqbuUwwV57HfVk12HVi/</a> <span style="color:grey">| © Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group.</span></div>

#### Notes on the Diagram

The abstract flowchart, titled ‘AI Dissidents,’ critically elucidates how the techno-social nature of artificial intelligence (AI) reflects the shaping of technical components by social processes, and vice versa. Artificial intelligence (AI), as a direct reflection of a neoliberal social vision, intensifies the automation of social interactions across all aspects of life, continuously transforming social experiences into the enactment of various algorithmic processes.

### 2024 - Algorithmic Empire

_This visual representation provides a comprehensive overview of the conceptual framework of the 'Algorithmic Empire,' delineating its foundational origins, operational mechanisms, and prevailing practices within broader socio-techno-political dynamics._

#### Notes on the Diagram

Employing the analytical framework of ‘Empire,’ this intertwined feedback loop explores the critical concept of the ‘Algorithmic Empire,’ delineating its foundational origins, operational mechanisms, and prevailing practices, alongside the unchecked expansion of its dehumanizing and harmful features, which continue to deepen and intensify, with marginalized identities and communities enduring the harshest impacts. The illustration of these endemic issues underscores the interlocking systems of oppression upon which the ‘Algorithmic Empire’ is built.

***

### 2024 - Technopolitics of Refusal

_An intertwined feedback loop between technopolitical strategies of refusal, disruptive techniques, and the potentialities of resistance, situated within the broader context of the 'Algorithmic Empire.'_

<div class="caption"><img src="images/output-022.png">The diagram <em>‘Technopolitics of Refusal’</em> is available for download in <code>PDF</code> format via the following link: <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/+Q3LBu5wMSSwfJfK8XtdASo1/">https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/+Q3LBu5wMSSwfJfK8XtdASo1/</a> <span style="color:grey">| © Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group.</span></div>

#### Notes on the Diagram

The activity illustrated through the ‘Technopolitics of Refusal’ abstract flowchart is understood not merely as a means of mitigation but as a transformative objective—one that seeks to reimagine alternative futures and propose possible worlds capable of replacing the unending social violence of the present. This entails the elevation of relational, embodied, and democratic decision-making over reductive automation, alongside a vision of restrained yet creative technological development oriented toward social production and radical inclusion.

### 2024 - AI’s Algorithmic Violence

_This preliminary version of an intertwined feedback loop offers a critical analysis of the multifaceted manifestations of algorithmic violence perpetuated by artificial intelligence (AI) in epistemic, administrative, and structural forms._

<div class="caption"><img src="images/output-031.png">The diagram <em>‘AI’s Algorithmic Violence’</em> is available for download in <code>PDF</code> format via the following link: <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/HlQw9BYZPRBP9FyCzipqKIWy/">https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/HlQw9BYZPRBP9FyCzipqKIWy/</a> <span style="color:grey">| © Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group.</span></div>

#### Notes on the Diagram

This preliminary version of an abstract flowchart, titled ‘AI’s Algorithmic Violence,’ provides a critical analysis of artificial intelligence (AI)’s inherent tendencies toward epistemic, structural, and administrative violence—tendencies that are not flaws but integral features. It illustrates how artificial intelligence (AI) exacerbates existing inequalities and injustices, thereby reinforcing social divisions and advancing the trajectory toward full algorithmic authoritarianism.

***

### 2024 - Technopolitics of Fronts

_This intertwined feedback loop offers a critical overview of the procedural aspects, aesthetic qualities, and functional characteristics associated with the concept of the ‘Technopolitics of Fronts,’ examining its theoretical foundations and practical extensions._

#### Notes on the Diagram

The abstract flowchart, titled ‘Technopolitics of Fronts,’ provides a comprehensive and critical overview of the procedural aspects, aesthetic dimensions, and functional characteristics inherent to the concept of ‘Technopolitics of Fronts,’ systematically examining its theoretical underpinnings, methodological frameworks, and practical extensions within broader techno-socio-environmental and political contexts.
