## Context

The Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) has developed a series of interconnected feedback loops that emerge from several interrelated briefs for intellectual and practical exploration. These critically subversive flowcharts are informed by research on digital labor exploitation, invisible infrastructures, techno-colonialism, and the automated technologies of tracking, monitoring, and surveillance, alongside numerous other contemporary phenomena situated at the intersection of technology and society.

### Abolishing AI

This preliminary version of an intertwined feedback loop advocates for an AI abolitionist praxis by critically exposing the multiplicity of its detrimental impacts, along with its inextricable entanglement in various forms of violence. It examines the nationalist, authoritarian, and fascist logics underpinning AI systems, alongside their ideological commitment to large-scale algorithmic cruelty.

***

### AI Dissidents

This intertwined feedback loop aims to critically elucidate the inherent constraints and obfuscations embedded within AI, particularly in relation to the conceptual framework of _“Algorithmic Empire.”_

***

### Algorithmic Empire

This visual representation offers a comprehensive overview of the conceptual framework of _“Algorithmic Empire,”_ delineating its foundational origins, operational mechanisms, and prevailing practices within the broader socio-political and technological dynamics.

***

### Technopolitics of Refusal

An intertwined feedback loop between technopolitical strategies of refusal, disruptive techniques, and the potentialities of resistance, situated within the context of the _“Algorithmic Empire.”_

***

### Algorithmic Sabotage

This intertwined feedback loop provides a critical examination of the underlying principles, strategic approaches, and aesthetic manifestations inherent to _“Algorithmic Sabotage,”_ positioning them within a broader theoretical and praxis-oriented framework.

***

### AI’s Algorithmic Violence

This preliminary version of an intertwined feedback loop offers a critical analysis of the multifaceted manifestations of algorithmic violence perpetuated by AI in epistemic, administrative, and structural forms.

***

### Technopolitics of Fronts

This intertwined feedback loop offers a critical overview of the procedural aspects, aesthetic qualities, and functional characteristics associated with the concept of the _“Technopolitics of Fronts,”_ examining its theoretical foundations and practical extensions.
