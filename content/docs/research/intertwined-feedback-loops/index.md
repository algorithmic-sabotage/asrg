## Context

The Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) has drawn a series of intertwined feedback loops that unfold from several interrelated briefs for intellectual and practical exploration. These critically subversive flowcharts have been informed by research on digital labour exploitation, invisible infrastructures, techno-colonialism, automatised technologies of tracking, monitoring, and surveillance, and many other contemporary phenomena at the intersection between technology and society.

### ABOLISHING AI

This is a preliminary version of an intertwined feedback loop that promotes an AI abolitionist praxis by exposing the multiplicity of its harms and its irrevocable entanglement with various registers of violence, its nationalist, authoritarian and fascist logics, and its ideological commitment to algorithmic cruelty on a grand scale.

***

### AI DISSIDENTS

This intertwined feedback loop serves to illustrate the inherent constraints and obfuscations associated with AI within the context of _“Algorithmic Empire.”_

### ALGORITHMIC EMPIRE

This visual representation provides an illustrative overview of the framework of _“Algorithmic Empire,”_ delineating its fundamental origins, operational mechanisms, and prevailing practices.

### TECHNOPOLITICS OF REFUSAL

An intertwined feedback loop between the technopolitical strategies of refusal, the techniques of disruption and the potentialities of resistance in the context of _“Algorithmic Empire”_.

***

### ALGORITHMIC SABOTAGE

This intertwined feedback loop examines the underlying principles, strategic methodologies and aesthetic dimensions of _“Algorithmic Sabotage”_.

***

### AI’S ALGORITHMIC VIOLENCE

This is an initial version of an intertwined feedback loop that illustrates the various manifestations of algorithmic violence perpetrated by AI in epistemic, administrative, and structural forms.

### TECHNOPOLITICS OF FRONTS

This intertwined feedback loop provides an illustrative overview of the procedural aspects, aesthetic qualities, and functional characteristics associated with the critical concept of _‘Technopolitics of Fronts.’_ <span style="color:grey">* Further information can be accessed via the following link: https://algorithmic-sabotage.github.io/asrg/technopolitics-of-fronts/.</span>
