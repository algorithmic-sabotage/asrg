## Context

_“We live in the age of digital data, and in that age mathematics has become the parliament of politics. The social law has become interwoven with models, theorems and algorithms. With digital data, mathematics has become the dominant means in which human beings coordinate with technology … Mathematics is a human activity after all. Like any other human activity, it carries the possibilities of both emancipation and oppression.” — Politically Mathematics Manifesto, 2019[^1]_

Across Europe and globally, artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly developed and deployed in ways that facilitate harmful and discriminatory state surveillance practices. These systems often leverage biometric technologies for identification, recognition, and categorization, alongside predictive algorithms for decision-making and resource allocation. In law enforcement, these applications disproportionately target marginalized communities, erode legal and procedural protections, and facilitate mass surveillance. The deployment of AI in law enforcement, security, and migration control—including the policing of social security—exacerbates power asymmetries between authorities and those under surveillance. This heightened imbalance significantly increases the risk of harm, undermines fundamental rights, and poses serious threats to the rule of law.

Artificial intelligence (AI) not only undermines due process but also fosters a form of thoughtlessness, as political philosopher Hannah Arendt described when analyzing the actions of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann. This thoughtlessness reflects an inability to critically evaluate instructions, a failure to reflect on the potential consequences, and an adherence to the belief that a correct and just process is being followed. In the context of AI's real-world impact, the primary concerns are discrimination and segregation. AI can be seen as a technology that perpetuates racism, reinforcing systems of racial and social segregation. In this sense, racism itself may be conceptualized as a technology of segregation, with AI playing a central role in its contemporary manifestation.

This is particularly evident in the deployment of facial recognition technology, which stands as one of the most contentious and ethically problematic applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to date. The concern extends beyond the mere fact that facial recognition systems exhibit lower accuracy rates when applied to individuals of color; more fundamentally, it lies in the way these technologies facilitate what Simone Browne terms _'digital epidermalization'—'the exercise of power cast by the disembodied gaze of certain surveillance technologies… that can be employed to do the work of alienating the subject by producing a truth about the racial body and one’s identity (or identities) despite the subject’s claims.'_[^2] In this context, facial recognition technology is implicated not only in reinforcing racialized power structures but also in the construction of a racialized truth that undermines individual autonomy and agency.

Facial recognition technology is a profoundly invasive, discriminatory, and biased mechanism. It reinforces structural power imbalances, perpetuates racial discrimination, sustains systems of racism, and facilitates authoritarian control. Within the European Union, AI-driven facial recognition systems are deployed in public spaces to capture and analyze facial features, classifying individuals into racial and ethnic categories such as Roma and Sinti. This process implicitly associates non-white individuals with suspicion, reinforcing racialized surveillance practices that exacerbate social inequalities and deepen the marginalization of racial and ethnic minorities.

The _Police Officers Faces (POF)_ dataset is an investigative counter-surveillance artistic project that critically interrogates the deployment of facial recognition technology, with particular focus on its use by law enforcement agencies. The dataset comprises 88,783 facial images of thousands of police officers, meticulously collected from publicly accessible online sources and repurposed for facial recognition. By subverting the traditional applications of this technology, the project challenges the ethical ramifications of such systems and critiques their role in normalizing state power. In a bold inversion of the conventional paradigm—where the powerful observe and monitor the powerless—the _‘POF’_ dataset redirects the surveillance gaze, enabling citizens to scrutinize those in positions of authority. This inversion disrupts the inherently asymmetrical nature of monitoring mechanisms, fostering critical reflection on the power dynamics embedded in these technologies and raising essential questions about ethics, accountability, and transparency.

To counter the dehumanizing effects of automated discrimination, systemic segregation, and the amplification of harm, this project proposes a radical technical framework—a collective _‘counter-intelligence.’_ This approach challenges the centralized control of surveillance technologies and emphasizes the transformative potential of citizen- and community-led efforts in resisting and dismantling unjust systems. By employing a multifaceted methodology that integrates targeted data collection, social engineering, and rigorous analytical techniques, the _‘POF’_ dataset offers a comprehensive structural alternative to prevailing surveillance models that disproportionately target marginalized communities. It not only empowers individuals engaged in copwatch, counter-surveillance, and other resistance practices but also fosters an operational framework that equips independent actors and grassroots movements with the necessary means to advance transparency, institutional accountability, and structural justice.

### Dataset Description

The _Police Officers Faces (POF)_ dataset constitutes a meticulously curated collection of facial images of law enforcement officers, derived from publicly accessible online sources. The dataset comprises 88,783 aligned and cropped facial images, each formatted to a resolution of 200×280 pixels. Each image is centered on a single face, with the majority being labeled with the name of the individual depicted. On average, each individual is represented by `12.22` facial images. Unlike most existing facial recognition datasets, the images in this collection were obtained in entirely uncontrolled settings, with subjects who were uncooperative. Consequently, the dataset exhibits considerable variability across multiple dimensions, including pose, resolution, lighting conditions, facial expressions, scene composition, imaging conditions, and other technical parameters.

The dataset includes JPEG-formatted images supplemented by detailed metadata stored in `JSON` and `CSV` formats. Part of this metadata encompasses facial bounding box coordinates and biometric landmark data, providing a robust framework for advanced analysis. Furthermore, the dataset includes comprehensive personal identifiers, such as the full names of the depicted individuals, enhancing its utility for identification, verification, and recognition tasks. In addition, each facial image is annotated with seventy-three distinct attributes, organized into three primary recognition domains: age group, gender, and a diverse array of visual characteristics. These visual traits encompass attributes such as hair color, face shape, and the presence of makeup, thereby enabling multifaceted recognition and analytical capabilities.

## Supplemental Information

### Annotated Sample Images

The following section presents a randomly selected subset of sample images, each annotated with the corresponding seventy-three attribute labels. The frequency distribution of these labels has been visualized using the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library. To preserve the privacy of the individuals depicted, the faces in the images have been redacted.

<span style="color:grey">* It is important to note that this specific section of the dataset employs a model with inherent limitations, which categorizes faces in a strictly discriminative manner. Additionally, the ground truth for the face attribute annotations is derived through automatic estimation, and these annotations have not been independently verified by human annotators.</span>
