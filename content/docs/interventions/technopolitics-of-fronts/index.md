## Context

_“Nothing’s more important than stopping fascism, because fascism will stop us all.”_ — Fred Hampton, Black Panther Party[^1]

_“If you think technology will solve your problems, you don’t understand technology — and you don’t understand your problems.”_ — Laurie Anderson[^2] 

... The Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) is proceeding with the formation of the Communitarian Assembly on ‘Technopolitics of Fronts’. A self-​constituting, bottom-up, horizontally organised structure that counterbalances those aspects of computing that are toxic to ethics. A structural alternative framework that _‘slow the universalizing process by unsettling existing assumptions, boundaries and patterns of political action’[^3]_. The objective of the Communitarian Assembly on ‘Technopolitics of Fronts’ is to create a kind of circuit-breaker, where the complexities of situated knowledge can be counterposed to the harmfulness of unrestrained automated algorithmic solutionism. As an adoptive structure that reverses exclusion and exception and enables participation and empowerment, the Communitarian Assembly on ‘Technopolitics of Fronts’ acts as a brake to the careless and often cruel consequences of fake automation and thoughtless algorithmic optimisation, mitigating the risk that comes with the new powers of machinery embedded in patterns that deepen harm.
