## Context

_‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs more important than stopping fascism, because fascism will stop us all.‚Äù_ <span style="color:grey">‚Äî Fred Hampton, Black Panther Party[^1]</span>

_‚ÄúIf you think technology will solve your problems, you don‚Äôt understand technology ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt understand your problems.‚Äù_ <span style="color:grey">‚Äî Laurie Anderson[^2]</span>

The Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) is undertaking the formation of the _Communitarian Assembly on ‚ÄòTechnopolitics of Fronts.‚Äô_ This initiative constitutes a self-organizing, bottom-up, and horizontally structured movement-building framework, strategically conceived to facilitate and enhance community-driven efforts focused on constraining the pernicious and deleterious practices of contemporary hyperscale computation. The assembly aims to function as a critical counterforce to the often reckless and ethically problematic consequences of unrestrained reductive technosolutionism, fake automation, and algorithmic operations of hyper-abstracted optimization, striving to mitigate the risks posed by the expanding influence of computational algorithms embedded in frameworks that perpetuate and amplify harm.

### Assembly Objectives

The core objectives of the _Communitarian Assembly on ‚ÄòTechnopolitics of Fronts‚Äô_ are articulated as follows:

1. To operate as a pivotal and strategically coordinated platform for the orchestration of collective action, thereby enabling the systematic mobilization of a diverse coalition of individuals and groups in alignment with a rigorously conceptualized and strategically articulated framework of resistance.

2. To serve as a prominent and transformative exemplification of the radical reconfiguration within a specific segment of the artistic-activist movement, functioning as a critical catalyst for the mobilization of collective action and the fostering of strategic counteraction against entrenched power structures emblematic of techno-feudal dynamics.

### Mode of Operation

The operational framework of the _Communitarian Assembly on ‚ÄòTechnopolitics of Fronts‚Äô_ is outlined below.

In its preliminary phase, the _Communitarian Assembly on ‚ÄòTechnopolitics of Fronts‚Äô_ operates as a closed, non-public entity, wherein both its organizational procedures and operational activities remain confidential and restricted. This initial structure is designed to foster a focused and controlled development of the assembly's core processes, ensuring that foundational decisions and internal deliberations are insulated from external pressures during the nascent stages of the initiative.

It is important to emphasize that, over the coming period, the proceedings of the assembly will progressively transition towards greater public accessibility, allowing for incremental transparency and the facilitation of broader engagement. This phased release of information aims to encourage direct participation from the public in the central aspects of the consultation process, while simultaneously safeguarding the integrity and deliberative autonomy of the assembly during its formative phase.

### Publications (Selection)

This subsection will present and facilitate access to the texts, articles, and essays authored by the assembly body, offering a detailed overview of their thematic focus, underlying objectives, and their significance within the broader context of the initiative.

### The Aesthetics of ‚ÄòTechnopolitics of Fronts‚Äô

The essay, authored by the _Communitarian Assembly on ‚ÄòTechnopolitics of Fronts‚Äô_ in October 2024, offers a critical dissection of the procedural dimensions, aesthetic qualities, and functional dynamics that underpin the foundational elements of the prefigurative framework of _‚ÄòTechnopolitics of Fronts‚Äô_.

### Abstract

This essay undertakes a rigorous and methodologically robust theoretical analysis of the procedural dimensions, aesthetic manifestations, and functional attributes that are inextricably linked to the critical concept of _‚ÄòTechnopolitics of Fronts.‚Äô_ It provides a comprehensive and systematic examination of the operationalization of this concept, scrutinizing its deployment across intersecting political, cultural, societal, and technological sites of struggle, elucidating the intricate and multifaceted interrelations between its conceptual foundations and practical facets. The analysis engages the ethical commitments, prefigurative methodologies, and militant praxes of resistance, agency, and refusal that constitute the scaffolding of this framework. Through a critical examination of these entangled aesthetic-political dynamics, the essay exposes the insurgent logics and tactical modalities, and advances a radical rearticulation of the techno-political field, foregrounding emergent antagonisms and transformative potentials.

### Abstract

This essay offers a critical review of the _Manifesto on ‚ÄúAlgorithmic Sabotage,‚Äù_ a theoretically rigorous and politically potent intervention within contemporary discourses on algorithmic totalitarianism, the machinic orchestration of social control, and insurgent refusals of technopolitical hegemony. Through a series of ten propositions, the manifesto articulates a militant alternative to prevailing neoliberal, reformist, and technocratic critiques of contemporary computation‚Äîunderstood not merely as a technical system, but as an apparatus, composed of configurations of concepts, investments, policies, institutions, and subjectivities that operate in concert to produce specific technical and social outcomes. It repositions sabotage not as an isolated act of disruption, but as a generative and insurgent praxis grounded in collective refusal and the radical reappropriation of technopolitical agency.

Each proposition is critically examined for its contribution to rethinking the conditions under which algorithmic domination is legitimized, naturalized, and operationalized across social, political, environmental, and knowledge-producing domains. Drawing upon anti-capitalist, anti-fascist, feminist, and decolonial struggles and analyses, the manifesto advances a prefigurative technopolitics that is simultaneously destructive of extant algorithmic power configurations and generative in cultivating alternatives grounded in relationality, critical reflection, and conviviality. Through a theoretically informed engagement with each proposition, this review elucidates the manifesto‚Äôs conceptual sophistication, its political commitments, and its potential as a catalyst for insurgent technopolitics‚Äîarticulating _‚ÄúAlgorithmic Sabotage‚Äù_ not as a techno-nihilistic rupture, but rather as a necessary and strategic refusal in response to escalating algorithmic violence and unrestrained fascist techno-solutionism.
